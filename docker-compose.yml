# Run the following command to start the services:
# docker-compose up, docker-compose up -d (detached mode)

# stop the services:
# docker-compose down

# --------------------------------------------

# For current development, I suggest just run the db into docker, and run the web server locally.
# To do that, you can run the following command:
# ``` docker-compose up db -d ```
